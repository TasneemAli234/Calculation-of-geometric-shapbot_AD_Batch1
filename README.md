Calculation-of-geometric-shap-telegram bot_AD_Batch1
# Intro:
 We did this project as a requirement for Python basics training in the AI approach club.
 # Objective
 This application of the basics that we learned in the training course in terms of dealing with variables, building classes, downloading and using libraries, applying the principles of object programming and the principles of SOLID, and making an application of service benefit to the user 
 # Steps :
 First, install and call libraries 
Second, creating a telegram bot using a father bot 
Third, the creation of classes and the application of the principles of object-oriented programming and the principles of SOLID
Fourth,Definition of the start function and the function of responding to user interactions 
Finally,then the definition of the main function.
# Conclusion of project:
This bot helps calculate the size, perimeter and area of some geometric shapes and is built in Python
